# typing-speed-test

Will update the JavaScript file very soon
Looking for any free API which lets me host it on Netlify or Vercel
will add live event listeners to match the typed data with the one required
To check for error and WPM
can add difficulty level
Need to add error detector as well
Working on the UI
- We can use supabase server to host data/paragraph
